# Image-Colorization-Using-Autoencoders

Image Colorization is a process of converting a grayscale image to color images. There are many potential
uses for image colorization. We have explored a variety of neural networks, methods, and architectures that
can be applied to the development of an image colorization model, including ImageNet, VGG16, and
Capsule network. However, because the convolutional autoencoders are so effective at teaching the abstract
representation of any type of data, we chose to implement it. And it requires little to no direct human
interaction.
